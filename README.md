# TicTacToe_Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple 2-player game where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal. If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. It's a classic example of a zero-sum game, where one player's win is the other's loss.
